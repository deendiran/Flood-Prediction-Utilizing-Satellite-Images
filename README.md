# Flood Prediction Utilizing Satellite Images

## Overview

The Flood Prediction System is a machine learning and image processing project aimed at predicting flood occurrences in areas near water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and seas. The system uses satellite imagery and geospatial analysis (GIS) to analyze terrain, water levels, and surrounding vegetation to provide flood predictions. This project is designed for research purposes and contributes to disaster preparedness and management.

## Features
- Utilizes Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite images.
- Incorporates geolocation data for mapping and analysis.
- Analyzes terrain, vegetation cover, and water levels to predict flooding.
- Employs machine learning models for flood prediction.
- Processes and normalizes datasets for accurate predictions.
