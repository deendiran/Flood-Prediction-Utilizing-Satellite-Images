all the info below is for creating a flood prediction system that will use geospatial analysis and satellite image

tell me what is required to make the user interface 
- okay for the user interface i want to use geolocation so that the system can be able to tell where the user is and capture the region of interest, i want the system interface to have a map that the user can use if they want to check flooding activity of a specific area. when the region of interest is pinned on the map i want a polygon area of the specified area to be captured and analyzed by the system. also it will be preferable if the system shows images captured of the area over a period of 10 days
* use leaflet.js api in the interface and get real time changes and still be able to extract the historical data from previous days from the map
* suggest how to use google earth engine 
* use postgresql as the database in the flood prediction system interface to store all the data related to the system
* tell me how i can get javascript code to work without using xampp
- use python for the backend

i want to create the user interface for it to have: 
* a map for where the user can pinpoint a place and get the polygon of the pinned place 
* the map should be for Kenya 
* a geolocation api 
* for it to show the result of the pinned region of interest and give the following details:    
1. approximate value of whether it is going to flood    
2. it should say whether there are high/medium/low chances of flooding 

* for it to focus only on areas surrounded by rivers, lakes, or any area near water bodies 
* i want for the landing page that a user first sees when accessing the system to have a map, login and registration button and any other thing that makes the UI stand out 
* i want for the home page to have a log out button 
* the sessions should work and i want that when i refresh a specific page for the page to remain the same and not go to another page 
* i want to have a forgotten password and an email verification and they should be functional 
* make sure that the system is able to analyze the vegetation density, amount of soil moisture and water levels of the area, carry out a flood prediction analysis, the system should show both current analysis and historical data from the past 10 days of the vegetation cover, water level and soil moisture (better if there is an image comparison of the said vegetation and water body features - use ndvi and ndwi). 
* ensure that the images being used to carry out the analysis are satellite images 
* hash the password in the database
* the system should also use geolocation to get the area they are in or be able to pin their area of interest on the map.
* i want for the map in the landing page and home page to be working and have different options
